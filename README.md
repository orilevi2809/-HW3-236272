1The class is "SnappingSheetController "
With this class we can :
control on the position 
and extract information from the sheet 
like current position, currentSnappingPosition,currentlySnapping etc.

2.The parameter nappingCurve allows the bottom sheet to snap into position with various different
animations

3.The main difference is GestureDetector provides more controls like dragging etc. on the other hand it doesn't include ripple effect tap, which InkWell does.
